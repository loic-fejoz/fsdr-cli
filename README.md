# fsdr-cli

A command line interface based on [FutureSDR](http://www.futuresdr.org) meant to be
* a line-for-line replacement of [csdr](https://github.com/ha7ilm/csdr),
* yet able to pack pipelined command in one unique-flowgraph,
* able to launch simple GNU Radio Companion flowgraph within FutureSDR runtime,
* a testing tool for [FutureSDR community blocks](https://github.com/FutureSDR/fsdr-blocks)
